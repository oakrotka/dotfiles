**Work In Progress!!**

As of writing this, I am currently using a messy NvChad config.
This is my attempt to obtain a configuration where I actually know
what features do I have and what is going on under the hood.
I will delete this file when this config will become usable enough
for me to switch to it (if I'll remember to).
