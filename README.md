# dotfiles
my dotfiles for arch linux.
I plan on keeping this repo clean, so I will gradually add more of my dotfiles here
when I'll be happy with them.
I use [catpuccin mocha theme](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) for most of my things.

you can install this configuration on your system using the command
```
./apply.sh
```
note that this creates symbolic links to this repository,
so when you move it somewhere else in your directory structure
you'll have to execute the command again.
